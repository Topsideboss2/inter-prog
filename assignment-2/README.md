# Assignment 2 - TODO List Application

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Application Overview  
Assignment 2 is a basic to-do list built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases essential web development techniques such as form handling, dynamic updates, and event-driven programming. Users can easily add tasks, while the task list updates in real-time without page reloads, offering a seamless user experience.

## Core Functionality  
The application's core functionality includes task addition. Users input a task description, and upon submission, itâ€™s displayed in a dynamically updated list. The JavaScript file (`script.js`) manages these interactions by querying and storing elements, handling events, and preventing unnecessary page reloads.

## File Structure and Usage  
To get started, users can download the files, including `index.html` (structure), `style.css` (styling), and `script.js` (logic). Opening the `index.html` file in a browser allows immediate interaction. The code structure is straightforward, with the HTML defining the basic layout, the CSS enhancing visual design, and the JavaScript controlling the dynamic behavior.
